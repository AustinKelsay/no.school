Thanks! I’ll look into how to create a single `RelayPool` instance using the `snstr` library within a `useSnstrContext` hook that wraps a Next.js App Router application. I’ll also evaluate whether `snstr` supports dynamic subscriptions and handles queuing effectively so that components can safely reuse the shared relay connection.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a reusable pattern and best practices based on the latest `snstr` source code and usage.


# Shared `RelayPool` via Context in Next.js

To use SNSTR’s RelayPool across a Next.js App Router app, wrap the app in a client-side context provider. SNSTR is a lightweight Nostr library that includes a multi-relay `RelayPool` for efficient event subscription and publishing. We can create a React `SnstrProvider` (marked with `"use client"`) that instantiates a single `RelayPool` and exposes it via context to all child components. In the root layout (a server component), we import this client-side provider and wrap `{children}`. For example, SNSTR’s documentation shows subscribing across relays with `RelayPool.subscribe(relays, filters, onEvent, onDone)`; we will give components access to the same `RelayPool` instance for such calls.

```tsx
// app/context/SnstrContext.tsx
"use client";

import React, { createContext, useContext, useRef } from 'react';
import { RelayPool } from 'snstr';

type SnstrContextType = {
  relayPool: RelayPool;
};
const SnstrContext = createContext<SnstrContextType | null>(null);

export function SnstrProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  // Define the relay URLs (could also come from props/env)
  const relays = ["wss://relay.nostr.band", "wss://nos.lol", "wss://relay.damus.io"];
  // Use a ref to hold the single RelayPool instance
  const poolRef = useRef<RelayPool>();
  if (!poolRef.current) {
    poolRef.current = new RelayPool(relays);
    // (Optionally configure rate limits or other options here)
  }

  return (
    <SnstrContext.Provider value={{ relayPool: poolRef.current }}>
      {children}
    </SnstrContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useSnstrContext(): SnstrContextType {
  const context = useContext(SnstrContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error("useSnstrContext must be used within SnstrProvider");
  }
  return context;
}
```

The above `SnstrProvider` is a **client component** (it has `"use client"`). In `app/layout.tsx`, we import and render it at the root, wrapping all pages:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx (server component)
import { SnstrProvider } from './context/SnstrContext';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {/* Wrap the entire app in the SNSTR provider */}
        <SnstrProvider>{children}</SnstrProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

This pattern follows Next.js guidelines: create a client-side `Providers` component and consume it in the root layout. By marking `SnstrProvider` as a client component, React Context (`useContext`) can be used and any third-party (WebSocket-based) library will only run in the browser. Inside `SnstrProvider`, we store a single `RelayPool` in a ref, so it is created only once (on first render) and shared by all components.

## Subscribing with RelayPool

Components can now call `useSnstrContext()` to get the shared `RelayPool`, and use it to subscribe or publish. For example, a component might subscribe to events with specific filters in a `useEffect`:

```tsx
// ExampleComponent.tsx
"use client";
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Filter } from 'snstr';
import { useSnstrContext } from './context/SnstrContext';

export function ExampleComponent({ authors }: { authors: string[] }) {
  const { relayPool } = useSnstrContext();
  const [events, setEvents] = useState<any[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Define filters for this component (e.g. kind 1 events by these authors)
    const filters: Filter[] = [{ kinds: [1], authors, limit: 20 }];
    const relays = ["wss://relay.nostr.band", "wss://nos.lol"]; // could also reuse default relays

    // Subscribe to events matching the filters
    const subscription = relayPool.subscribe(
      relays,
      filters,
      (event, relayUrl) => {
        // Append incoming event to state
        setEvents(prev => [...prev, event]);
      },
      (relayUrl) => {
        // EOSE (End Of Stored Events) for a relay
        console.log(`EOSE from ${relayUrl}`);
      }
    );

    // Cleanup on unmount: close this subscription
    return () => {
      subscription.close();
    };
  }, [relayPool, authors]);

  // Render the received events
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Notes by {authors.join(', ')}</h2>
      <ul>
        {events.map(e => <li key={e.id}>{e.content}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Each component can use different `filters`. Since all subscriptions use the same shared `RelayPool`, SNSTR will reuse connections and merge queries when possible. In the example above, calling `relayPool.subscribe([...], filters, onEvent, onDone)` returns a subscription object with a `.close()` method. This matches the SNSTR docs (see the multi-relay subscribe example). Internally, SNSTR’s `RelayPool` will batch subscriptions as needed; for instance, multiple calls to `subscribe` in rapid succession will be queued and sent together (controlled by the `maxDelay` option in nostr-relaypool). This means if two components mount at the same time with similar filters, SNSTR can combine them into one relay request to reduce traffic.

## Batching and Queueing Behavior

Under the hood, SNSTR’s RelayPool implements intelligent merging and batching of filters. According to the underlying relay-pool implementation, filters that “only differ in 1 key” will be merged, and empty queries are discarded. The `maxDelayms` parameter (if provided) delays sending subscriptions slightly to batch multiple calls: *“Adding maxDelay option delays sending subscription requests, batching them and matching them after the events come back”*. In practice, this means you can safely call `subscribe` from many components, and the RelayPool will consolidate requests efficiently. Likewise, if filters are already satisfied from the cache, SNSTR may immediately invoke callbacks with cached events without contacting relays. Thus, a single `RelayPool` instance handles queued and batched subscriptions correctly, ensuring that overlapping subscriptions do not redundantly hit the network.

## Client/Server Considerations in Next.js

Because `RelayPool` uses WebSockets (`window.WebSocket` under the hood), **it must run client-side**. That’s why the provider and any component using `useSnstrContext` should be marked with `"use client"`. Server components **cannot** use the `RelayPool` or `useSnstrContext` directly. In Next 13+, the pattern is to put context providers in client components and wrap the app in the root layout. This way, any child component that needs to subscribe can also be a client component. For example, pages that use subscriptions must begin with `'use client'`.

If you need to fetch Nostr events on the server (e.g. for SSR or initial page data), you can use SNSTR’s query methods (like `Nostr.fetchMany`) in an async server component or API route, since that uses HTTP/WebSocket fetches once and closes (no persistent listener). But the real-time `subscribe` pattern is only for client-side.

Be sure to clean up subscriptions on unmount to avoid memory leaks. In SNSTR you can use the `autoClose` option for one-off queries (which automatically unsubscribes after EOSE), or explicitly call `subscription.close()` as shown above. Also consider configuring SNSTR’s rate limits if your app makes many requests (see SNSTR’s documentation on rate-limiting).

## Example: Putting It All Together

1. **Create the SnstrProvider (client-side)**
   As shown above, define `SnstrProvider` with `"use client"`, initialize `RelayPool`, and use `React.createContext`. Expose a `useSnstrContext()` hook for convenience.
2. **Wrap the Root Layout**
   In `app/layout.tsx` (server component), import the provider and wrap your app:

   ```tsx
   import { SnstrProvider } from './context/SnstrContext';
   export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
     return (
       <html>
         <body>
           <SnstrProvider>{children}</SnstrProvider>
         </body>
       </html>
     );
   }
   ```

   This follows the recommended pattern.
3. **Use in Components (client-side)**
   In any client component, call `const { relayPool } = useSnstrContext()`. Then subscribe in a `useEffect`. For example, to listen for notes by certain authors:

   ```tsx
   useEffect(() => {
     const sub = relayPool.subscribe(defaultRelays, [{ kinds: [1], authors }], onEvent);
     return () => sub.close();
   }, [relayPool, authors]);
   ```

   This will reuse the shared pool.
4. **Handle Events and Cleanup**
   The `onEvent` callback will fire whenever matching events arrive. When the component unmounts or filters change, the cleanup calls `sub.close()`. This unsubscribes from the relays. SNSTR also supports an `{ autoClose: true }` option (as shown in docs) if you prefer automatic unsubscribing after initial results.

## Caveats and Best Practices

* **Client-only:** Ensure all SNSTR usage is in client components. The `SnstrProvider` itself must be a client component. Wrapping the app as shown avoids server-component errors.
* **Subscription Cleanup:** Always close subscriptions to avoid dangling queries. SNSTR’s `autoClose` or manually calling `.close()` (on the returned subscription) are recommended.
* **Rate Limits:** SNSTR has built-in rate limits (default \~50 subs/minute). You can configure higher limits via the Nostr client constructor if needed.
* **Server Data Fetching:** If you need initial data from Nostr in a server component, use SNSTR’s one-shot fetch methods (`fetchMany`, etc.) or run a small Nostr client on the server. Do **not** try to use the long-lived `RelayPool` in Node/SSR, since it assumes browser WebSockets.
* **Multiple Filters:** When components use different filters, SNSTR will manage them independently. Overlapping filters will be merged internally to prevent duplicate network requests.

In summary, by providing a single `RelayPool` via React Context, all components can share connections and subscriptions efficiently. This aligns with SNSTR’s design for multi-relay management and with Next.js’s context guidelines. With this pattern, dynamic, component-level subscriptions simply call the shared pool, and SNSTR takes care of batching and queuing behind the scenes.
