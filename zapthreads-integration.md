Great — I'll put together a guide on integrating Zapthreads' React SDK into your Next.js app, ensuring it uses your ShadCN theme via CSS variables, and supports dark mode.

I'll also make sure the guide highlights how to apply your existing `bg-background` / `text-foreground` conventions for a consistent UI appearance.

I'll get back to you shortly with a complete implementation guide.


# Implementing ZapThreads with Shadcn UI in Next.js

To integrate **ZapThreads** (a Nostr-powered threaded comment widget) into a Next.js app using the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) component library, follow these steps:

1. **Install and import ZapThreads.**  Add ZapThreads to your project and import its script on the client-side. For example:

   ```bash
   npm install zapthreads
   ```

   Then in your component (client-side only), import the module. For instance, using a React hook to defer loading until the browser (to avoid SSR issues):

   ```js
   useEffect(() => {
     import("zapthreads"); // dynamically import ZapThreads web component
   }, []);
   ```

   This pattern (shown in \[25]) ensures the custom element is defined after hydration, avoiding SSR errors. ZapThreads is then available as the `<zap-threads>` tag. Finally, use it in your JSX with a required `anchor` prop (a Nostr note/event/URL) and any optional attributes (e.g. user, relays):

   ```jsx
   <zap-threads 
     anchor="naddr1qqxnzd3cxqmrzv3exgmr2wfeqgsxu35yyt0mwjjh8pcz4zprhxegz69t4wr9t74vk6zne58wzh0waycrqsqqqa28pjfdhz"
     user="npub1wf4pufsucer5va8g9p0rj5dnhvfeh6d8w0g6eayaep5dhps6rsgs43dgh9"
     relays="wss://relay.nostr.band,wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.net/"
     disable="likes"
   />
   ```

   This follows the official usage pattern. (In TypeScript, you may also add a global JSX declaration for `"zap-threads"` to avoid type errors.)

2. **Wrap in Shadcn components.** Use your normal shadcn UI layout around the ZapThreads element. For example, you might place the widget inside a `<Card>` or `<div>` with shadcn classes. Shadcn’s theming uses CSS variables like `--background` and `--foreground` for colors. In JSX, you can apply classes like `bg-background text-foreground` to set these automatically (when you have `tailwind.cssVariables = true`). For example:

   ```jsx
   <Card className="bg-background text-foreground p-4">
     <zap-threads ... />
   </Card>
   ```

   This ensures the container follows your theme’s background/foreground colors (shadcn uses `--background` for background and `--foreground` for text by convention).

3. **Apply ZapThreads CSS variables to match the theme.** ZapThreads exposes its own CSS custom properties for styling (font, colors, etc.). You can set these on the `<zap-threads>` element (or a wrapping element) to align with shadcn’s theme. For example, map ZapThreads variables to shadcn’s variables:

   ```jsx
   <zap-threads 
     ... 
     style={{
       "--ztr-background-color": "var(--background)",
       "--ztr-text-color":       "var(--foreground)",
       "--ztr-link-color":       "var(--primary)",
       "--ztr-icon-color":       "var(--muted)",
       "--ztr-login-button-color":"var(--primary)"
     }}
   />
   ```

   Here we use `var(--background)` and `var(--foreground)` from shadcn’s global CSS (from `app/globals.css`) to style ZapThreads’ background and text. Likewise, you can use other theme variables (e.g. `--primary`, `--accent`, etc.) for `--ztr-link-color` or icons. This ensures the comment widget “plays along” with your color scheme. The list of ZapThreads CSS vars is documented in its README.

4. **Example Full Integration.** Putting it all together, a React component might look like this:

   ```jsx
   "use client";
   import { useEffect } from "react";
   import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

   export default function CommentSection({ anchorId }) {
     useEffect(() => {
       import("zapthreads"); // register <zap-threads>
     }, []);

     return (
       <Card className="bg-background text-foreground p-4">
         <zap-threads
           anchor={anchorId}
           style={{
             "--ztr-background-color": "var(--background)",
             "--ztr-text-color":       "var(--foreground)",
             "--ztr-link-color":       "var(--primary)",
             "--ztr-icon-color":       "var(--muted)",
             "--ztr-login-button-color":"var(--primary)"
           }}
         />
       </Card>
     );
   }
   ```

   The `<Card>` wrapper uses shadcn classes (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`) so its appearance matches your theme. Inside, `<zap-threads>` is styled via CSS variables to inherit the same colors.

5. **Outcome.** With this setup, ZapThreads will render inside your Next.js page and use your app’s theme colors. By leveraging CSS custom properties, the widget can adapt to light/dark mode and color themes defined in your shadcn config.
